Certifications and Self Study
===============================

This section is to showcase certifications that I have earned during my learning. 

I've broken this up into official certifications (like CompTIA) and other courses I've taken that do not have an official exam. I have learned a lot from the additional courses so I feel that they should be included here.

## Certifications

- Comptia A+
- Comptia Network+
- Comptia Security+
- Comptia CYSA+
- Comptia Project+
- Comptia Pentest+
- Axelos ITIL4
- ISC2 SSCP

## Self Study

- SOC Core Skills (Antisyphon Training)
